# Marvellous (https://marvellous-characters.herokuapp.com)
Final Project at Spiced Academy
This project is written in React.js without incorporating Redux.
There are two master apps. Welcome and App.
Welcome handles Login and registration. The welcome section defaults to Login
A link to a registration form can be accessed via a link if needed.
App handles all data from Marvel.
There is a search facilty on characters. All characters can be clicked on to
access the character description, larger image and a link to comics for that character
if any. The comics can also be clicked to access a description and larger image.
Also characters can be added as favourites. These favourites are by user and can be accessed
on their own page by a link on the main header. Favourites can be added and removed from the 
main characters section or removed from the favourites section.
There are nearly fifteen hundred Marvel characters so I've limited the initial search to fifty
minus those characters without images. I've also added the same functionality to the comics.
The header displays the users name, how many characters have been returned on the search and how 
many users have registered so far. There are also links to get back to the main characters section,
a logout link and a link to the favourites section.
